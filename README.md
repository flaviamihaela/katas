# katas

This repository contains small programming exercises (katas) designed to practice clean code, object-oriented design, and testable architecture.

## 1. Fortune Cookie Generator - Java
Console-based Java program that randomly selects and prints a humorous or thoughtful fortune message.

Encapsulates fortune messages using an enum FortuneMessage.

Retrieves a random message using Math.random().

Outputs the selected message via Fortune#reveal().

javac Fortune.java
java Fortune
```

## 2. Ruby â€“ Gilded Rose Kata
A Ruby implementation of the classic Gilded Rose kata. It simulates the daily update of items in an inventory with different rules based on item types.

- Regular items

- Aged Brie (improves with time)

- Backstage passes (increase in quality then drop to 0)

- Legendary items (do not change)


### Run & build
```bash
ruby gilded_rose.rb
```
